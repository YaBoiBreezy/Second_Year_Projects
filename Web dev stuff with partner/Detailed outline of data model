Detailed Outline of Data Model

Every object(movie, user, person) will have a page, so to link to an object 
we will use the object’s name to generate a URL for the HREF link. (ex. /users/{name} = /users/xXsteveXx)

Reviews will be stored using ID’s, each ID will be in the user who made the review, and the movie the review is for. 
Whenever either the movie or user is requested, all reviews corresponding to said user/movies’s review ID’s will be sent with the user/movie’s data.
