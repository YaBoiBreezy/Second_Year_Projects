all these HTML things also indicate JS requirements, which are tabbed

Probably make top bar for:
site name     search bar      login/logout/create account/personal page
If contributing user, add buttons for adding movie/person

REQUIRED HTML PAGES:
View movie:
title, year, rating average, runtime, plot, etc.
genre keywords, link to search for said keyword
see directors, writers, actors, all link to respective pages
list similar movies (algorithm)
add/remove from watched list
see reviews
add big review (1-10, short text, long text).
    if no text, just 1-10, then add as short review

view person:
director/writer/actor, one person per name
Acted, wrote, directed (diff sections): each movie links to said page
  If category=empty, don't show
frequent collaborators (list of 5 people)
  most frequent names in all movies in person's history
 Follow/unfollow: receive notification when new movie with this person is added

view personal page:
When logged in, on personal page:
  swap between normal and contributing user
  see/manage people they follow (link to pages, stop following)
  see/manage users they follow (link to pages, stop following)
  see/manage watched movies (link to pages, undo watched)
  list recommended movies (use reviews left, people/users followed to make algorithm)
  see notifications from followed people/users: people for new movies, user for reviews made. Can unfollow from list

view user:
see all reviews made
see all people followed (link)
see watched list (link)
follow/unfollow (notified when new review posted)

login/logout/
new acc:
take a username and password
  usernames must be unique
  only one acc logged in at a time on a browser
  new user is regular by default, not contributing

add new movie:
  When contributing user, button on top bar
  title, release year, runtime, plot, genre keywords, and at least one writer, director, and actor
    search for people must be dynamic, add person as writer/director/actor directly from search bar
    notification to all followers of people in this movie

add new person:
  When contributing user, button on top bar
  specify name, if name already exists then no.

movie search:
global search bar at top of screen
search for movies (actor name, genre, movie name). when enter, go to this page
show first 10 and have next/prev


We also need server interaction, MongoDB, etc. all run with "npm install" and nothing else.

For HTTP, we need:
get movie
get user 
get personal account
get person
login page
login (obviously can fail, handle it)
new account (obviously can fail, handle it)
Movie search (for all searches pretty much)
add/remove from watched list
add review
follow/unfollow user
follow/unfollow person
add movie
add person
dynamic search for add movie
maybe refresh every few seconds to see new notifications, display on top bar?

Marks:
50% meeting requirements
10% looks
15% database
25% HTTP/NodeJS
